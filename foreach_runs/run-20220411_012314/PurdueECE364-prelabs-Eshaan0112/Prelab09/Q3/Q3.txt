SQL Injection Protection:
1) Parameterized Statements
    In the example of an injection attack, the parameterized string and the parameters are not passed to the database separately. 
    If they are passed separately, then this allows the driver to correctly interpret them and prevent injection attacks. This can be seen in 
    the printed "Example 3" in main.py under Prelab09/Q3/main.py

2) Input Validation:
    To ensure valid input, Regular Expression can be used for structured database
    such as names or secure texts like username or passwords. 
    In "Example 2" in main.py under Prelab09/Q3/main.py,
    the expected type for username and password is 'text' however
    integers are being entered

3) Web Application Firewall (WAF):
    A WAF operating in front of the web servers monitors the traffic which goes in and out of the web servers.
    It identifies patterns that constitute a threat.
    Essentially, it is a barrier put between the web application and the Internet,
    so in all examples under Prelab09/Q3/main.py, whenever we go to the HTML file to
    fill the login information, a WAF checks for security
