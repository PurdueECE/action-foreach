One way to sanitize inputs is to pass variables as named parameters.
Ex: cursor.execute("SELECT firstname, lastname from users WHERE id = %d'",(username,))

One way is to use SQL Composition
Ex: Psycopg

One way is to use safe query parameters through a different module to compose SQL queries
Ex: cursor.execute("""SELECT firstname, lastname from users WHERE id = %(id)s""",{'id'}=id)
