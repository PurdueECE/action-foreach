Common Ways to Sanitize Input

Research from https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-attacks/#3

1. One way to prevent SQL injection attacks is input validation.
You can do this by using regex to evaluate the string that the user 
has inputted. If the range of strings that a user can input is limited,
such as using a drop-down list or radio buttons, you can simply use those
appropriate strings to validate the strings, which can be done in a switch case or 
if-else branches.

2. Another way is to use parametrized queries. This is just a fancy way of saying
that the program will compile the SQL query to make sure that is actual code and not
commands that will manipulate the data in an unsecure way. It does this by automatically
quoting the data in order to avoid an SQL injection attack.

3. The ultimate way to do it would be used stored procedures, which is structuring the SQL commands
in a way that can be reused by the programmer instead of manually writing the command over and over 
again. By doing so, it can allow for the commands to be automatically parametrized and does not allow 
excess access to the user.
